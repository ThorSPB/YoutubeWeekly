# YoutubeWeekly

📽️ **YoutubeWeekly** is a simple, self-sufficient desktop app designed to automatically download weekly videos from two specific YouTube channels.  
It finds the correct video for the current or upcoming Sabbath and saves it into organized folders for easy playback — no copy-pasting links or hunting through YouTube necessary.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This app is written in **Python** using `tkinter`, `yt-dlp`, and is intended to be packaged into a standalone executable using `PyInstaller`.

//this readme is as well a work in progress just like the project. It's only made by me and since it's unfinished some things make look slight (maybe more) messy!
